				<h1 class="text-primary">Main gameplay</h1>
				<p>Gameplay in Bloons TD 6 is similar to previous games. The core gameplay is to stop enemy Bloons from reaching the exit(s) by making a defense consisting of various towers (called "Monkeys" in-game though some are clearly not monkeys). Popping Bloons will earn money, and can be used to buy more towers or upgrade existing towers. Each tower has a different role in the game. The game is played from a fixed top-down perspective, just like all other games of the Bloons TD series, but Bloons TD 6 uses 3D graphics, unlike any other of its previous games.</p>
				<p>Bloons TD 6 introduces many new game mechanics, including Heroes, new Bloon types, 5th-tier upgrades, and a third upgrade path for each monkey. DDTs, which first appeared in Bloons Monkey City, also return in Bloons TD 6. The game also introduces three new Bloon types: The BAD (Big Airship of Doom) is the new strongest bloon in the game, and is immune to any form of slowdown, knockback, or instakill. Purple Bloons have been are a new counterpart to the Black and White Bloons, and are immune to fire, plasma, and energy weapons. The Fortified Bloon property is introduced alongside the returning Camo and Regrow properties; bloons with this property are stronger variations of their regular counterpart (the Fortified property will double the health of all bloons it is applied to except for Leads, which quadruples its health). Line of Sight is a new game mechanic that appears on certain maps, where certain types of obstacles can block certain towers from seeing over them.</p>
				<p>Each game is divided into rounds. Every round normally consists of a pre-defined set of bloons of various densities and different bloon types, although Apopalypse Mode rounds are randomized on every new game. All rounds will gradually introduce more Bloon types and get harder the later the player progresses. Before starting a game, players are prompted to choose a mode - Easy, Medium, or Hard - and select a sub-mode. The variety of modes in Bloons TD 6 allows players to play the same map in many different ways, making the game more diverse than previous installments in the Bloons TD series. Upon completing a game, players will get a certain amount of Monkey Money based on the difficulty of the map chosen, and the mode chosen. After a map's first completion on a difficulty, the amount of Monkey Money rewarded upon completion is significantly reduced.</p>
				<p>MOAB-Class bloons such as the MOAB, BFB, ZOMG and DDT return in BTD6, along with the new BAD bloon. These bloons only appear in rounds 40+, however, they all have a lot of health. MOABs require 200 hits to pop, BFBs require 700 hits to pop, ZOMGs require 4,000 hits to pop, DDTs require 400 hits to pop and BADs require 20,000 hits to pop, all gaining more health every round after Round 80. After defeating Round 100, players will receive an "Insta-Monkey" which has the chance of already having upgrades that can be placed for free in any mode except for C.H.I.M.P.S. and challenges with no powers.</p>
				<p>Just like in BTD5, players can earn Monkey Money to unlock more stuff, including Powers, new Heroes, certain cosmetics, and unlock deeper Monkey Knowledge in conjunction with Monkey Knowledge Points. There is a new rare currency in the game called Trophies. Trophies can be used in the Trophy Store to unlock exclusive cosmetics not unlockable by Monkey Money.</p>

				<h1 class="text-primary">Tutorial</h1>
				<p>Upon playing the game for the first time, Tutorial Monkey gives a tutorial on how to play the game. On the map Town Center, he declares the aim of the game: "Stop the Bloons from getting through!" The player is then instructed to place a 0-0-0 Dart Monkey inside the designated circle. After placing a second 0-0-0 Dart Monkey in another part of the track, the first round can be played. Tutorial Monkey then points out the Play button, which is used to begin the next round.</p>
				<p>After beating the second round, he points out that popping Bloons earns the monkeys experience: "Popping Bloons earns your Monkeys experience!" He then instructs the player to tap on the Dart Monkey icon to unlock an upgrade. He tells the player that "each Monkey type has 5 upgrades in 3 paths," after which the player is free to choose one of the Dart Monkey's Tier 1 upgrades to unlock.</p>
				<p>After unlocking an upgrade, Tutorial Monkey tells the player that he needs to apply the upgrade to the Dart Monkeys in play in order for them to be able to use it.</p>
				<p>After completing Round 3, Quincy, one of the thirteen current heroes, arrives. Tutorial Monkey tells the player that Quincy is a Monkey Hero that upgrades himself throughout the course of the game.</p>
				<p>After Round 4 is completed, the player levels up to Level 2, allowing the player to unlock a Primary Monkey. The choices for them are Boomerang Monkey, Tack Shooter, Bomb Shooter, Ice Monkey, and Glue Gunner. The same process occurs after Round 9 is completed, which is when the player levels up to Level 3, allowing the player to unlock another Primary Monkey.</p>
				<p>After Round 10, the player wins the tutorial game and earns 100 Monkey Money.</p>
