Get ready for a massive 3D tower defense game designed to give you hours and hours of the best strategy gaming available. Craft your perfect defense from a combination of awesome monkey towers, upgrades, Heroes, and activated abilities, then pop every last Bloon that comes your way!</blockquote>
				<p>Bloons TD 6 (Bloons Tower Defense 6 or BTD6) is the latest installment and current flagship title of the Bloons Tower Defense series. Developed and published by Ninja Kiwi, the game was released on June 13, 2018 for Android and iOS, and later brought to Steam for Windows and Macintosh. Like other tower defense games, including those in the BTD series, the objective of Bloons TD 6 is to prevent enemy balloons, referred to as "Bloons", from traversing a track and taking lives. The player achieves this by using a combination of monkey-based towers to pop the Bloons before they can escape. As a sequel to Bloons TD 5 and its generational spinoffs, Bloons TD 6 introduces 3D graphics, line-of-sight mechanics, additional Bloon types (specifically the Purple Bloon, the Fortified property, and the Big Airship of Doom), Heroes, 5th-tier upgrades, a third upgrade path, expanded cosmetics, and more.</p>
				<p>Major updates to Bloons TD 6 usually focus on implementing balance changes to towers, at 1 new map and other exclusive content. This includes the addition of new Heroes, weekly events, public profiles, and Paragons.</p>
				<p>Three new towers were added after the games initial release: the Mortar Monkey (v6.0), Engineer Monkey (v12.0), and Dartling Gunner (v22.0). Many features from Bloons TD 5 Mobile and Bloons Monkey City also return, including Odysseys, the Golden Bloon, Monkey Teams, Boss Bloon Events, and Contested Territory.</p>
				<p>Bloons TD 6 is available for both mobile and desktop devices, which can purchased for $4.99 USD on mobile stores and $9.99 USD on desktop stores. Bloons TD 6+ is an exclusive Apple Arcade version that can be played with an Apple Arcade service. Starting from 18th August 2022 (announced on the Version 32.0 patch notes), the cost of both mobile and desktop versions have increased; mobile versions of Bloons TD 6 increased by $2 USD, or $4 USD for desktop versions.</p>
